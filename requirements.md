# Detailed features and implementations - Main router board
Describes specifics for hardware implementation and design requirements on a technical level. The overall KORUZA system consists of 2 standalone boards: Main router board, Koruza board (power supply + KORUZA control). Hereby we are specifying router board only.

## SFP interface
There are two SFP port, one is with cage facing the connector edge of the board, and one is internal. The internal SFP port is without the cage, but he will be also facing the connector edge of the board and have space for the cage to be soldered if needed.

 * SFP ports
  * external SFP (marked A) (1Gbps) with cage via PHY to RGMII port (RGMII - WAN2 as marked on MqMaker WiTi)
  * internal SFP (marked B) (1Gbps) with cage (do not install it) via PHY to switch port (port P4 - WAN as marked on MqMaker WiTi)

The implementation of SFP ports must comply with SFP MSA standard and power supply must be filtered according to specification.

## I2C Mux
Because the main CPU has only one I2C bus, there is a need for some kind of multiplexing because of two SFP ports. The additional requirement is to have I2C of internal SFP port also on the expander connector like shown in the diagram below.

## Power supply
The main router board operates at 5V power and has a respective input for 5V. PoE functionality is implemented as separate Power supply board that connect though a GPIO expansion connector.
