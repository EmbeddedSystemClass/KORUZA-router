# Detailed features and implementations - Main router board
Describes specifics for hardware implementation and design requirements on a technical level. The overall KORUZA system consists of 3 standalone boards: Main router board, power supply board and KORUZA control board. Hereby we are specifying router board only.

## SFP interface
There are two SFP port, one is with cage facing the connector edge of the board, and one is internal. The internal SFP port is without the cage, but he will be also facing the connector edge of the board and have space for the cage to be soldered if needed.

 * SFP ports
  * external SFP+ (marked A) (1Gbps) with cage, connected to multiplexer that switches it to SerDes PHY and then to CPU via RGMII port
  * internal SFP (marked B) (1Gbps only), connected to SerDes PHY and then CPU directly to switch

The implementation of SFP ports must comply with SFP MSA standard and power supply must be filtered according to specification.

## Power supply
The main router board operates at 5V power and has a respective input for 5V. PoE functionality is implemented as separate Power supply board that connect though a Power board connector.
